Yet another fork from https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048

Modify:
* now width and height may not equal, and default value is 1 * 21
* 90% probability generate tile 2. And 10% probability generate tile 2, too.
* Removed some support for mobile, since I do not know how to display well...
* Added ".AOE" keys work like "WASD", as I am a Dvorak layout user...
* 移除了所有Tweet的链接，原因大概就是你看我这句话都没用英文写
